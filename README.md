## **Description**

This website's functionality has been designed to generate randomized secure passwords through the use of JavaScript. Once the page is loaded, the user will be presented with a display that will allow them to click on a button "Generate Password" to get started. The user may choose a password length that is between 8-128 characters, otherwise they will be prompted to try again. The user may also choose the criteria for their password, including numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, & special characters. Once the user has made all of their criteria selections, they will be generated a random password based on their chosen criteria.
